Orientation matters for the following parts: ATMEGA8U2, Darlington array, 10uF Capacitor SMD tantal 1206/3216 metric; it does not matter for the Crystal.

We're not populating the 100kOhm resistor.

The USB cables we use have the following colors:
VCC: red
GND: black
D-: white
D+: green

We're soldering the USB cable so that the cable arises from the top (component) layer.
